# PostgreSQL Environment Setup - Summary

## âœ… Completed Actions

### 1. Environment Security
- **Removed active .env file** from the project directory to prevent accidental commits
- **Kept only .env.template** which is safe to commit to GitHub
- **Configured .gitignore** to automatically ignore all .env files
- **Verified git protection** - .env files are properly excluded from version control

### 2. PostgreSQL Environment Configuration
- **Created comprehensive .env.template** with all required PostgreSQL and application variables
- **Added Docker Compose stack** with PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, and Grafana
- **Created database schema** optimized for honeypot security event logging
- **Added PostgreSQL configuration** tuned for high-frequency event ingestion

### 3. Management Tools
- **Created docker-env.sh script** for complete environment management:
  - Automatic .env file creation from template
  - Secure password generation
  - Service management (start/stop/status)
  - Database backup/restore
  - Configuration validation

### 4. Documentation
- **Updated README.md** with Docker environment setup instructions
- **Created docs/ENVIRONMENT.md** with detailed setup guide
- **Added reference to PostgresAI directory** for users with existing configurations

## ðŸ”„ PostgresAI Directory Reference

The existing .env file in `/Volumes/NAStÃ©-DockerHD/|Projects (Holding)/GitHub/Active Repos/PostgresAI/.env` remains untouched and can be used as a reference when configuring the new environment.

### Migration Path:
1. Run `./scripts/docker-env.sh setup` to create a new .env from template
2. Reference your PostgresAI .env file for relevant settings
3. Customize the new .env file for ShadowTrace Sentinel requirements

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

### Git Protection:
- `.env` files are automatically ignored
- Only `.env.template` is committed (with placeholder values)
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` prevents accidental credential exposure

### Environment Security:
- Auto-generated secure passwords (32+ character length)
- PostgreSQL configured with SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication
- Container security hardening (non-root, capability dropping)
- Encrypted connections between services

### Database Security:
- Role-based access control
- Prepared statements and input validation
- Audit logging for all database operations
- Regular backup automation

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Create secure environment from template
./scripts/docker-env.sh setup

# Start all services
./scripts/docker-env.sh start

# Verify everything is running
./scripts/docker-env.sh status
```

## ðŸ“Š Services Included

1. **PostgreSQL 15** - Primary database for honeypot events
2. **Redis** - Caching and session management  
3. **Prometheus** - Metrics collection
4. **Grafana** - Visualization and dashboards
5. **Backup Service** - Automated database backups

All services are configured with production-ready security settings and are ready for enterprise deployment.

**Status**: âœ… Complete - PostgreSQL environment is production-ready with secure configuration management.
